DATA ANALYSIS
Analysis was performed to identify the behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members across daily and monthly timeframes.

By grouping the results by user type and the day of the week, I can identify specific patterns—such as which group
uses the bikes for commuting (consistent, short trips) versus leisure (longer, weekend trips).

1. FREQUENCY AND DEPTH USAGE (Daily)
-- Querying frequency and duration by user type and day
SELECT  
  member_casual,
  day_of_week_num,
  COUNT(*) AS num_of_rides,
  ROUND(AVG(ride_length_mins)) AS avg_ride_duration
FROM `case-study-2025-483513.cyclistic_cs.2025_full_year_cleaned` 
GROUP BY
  member_casual, day_of_week_num
ORDER BY
  member_casual, day_of_week_num;

2. SEASONALITY ANALYSIS (Monthly)
-- Analyzes ride counts by month to identify peak seasons
SELECT  
  member_casual,
  month_num,
  month_name,
  COUNT(*) AS num_of_rides,
  ROUND(AVG(ride_length_mins), 2) AS avg_ride_duration
FROM `case-study-2025-483513.cyclistic_cs.2025_full_year_cleaned` 
GROUP BY
  member_casual, month_num, month_name
ORDER BY
  member_casual, month_num;
