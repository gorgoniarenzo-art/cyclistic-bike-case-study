Data Analysis
Data analysis was performed to identify the behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members.
I ran a summary query to calculate the total number of rides and the average trip duration for every day of the week.

I aggregated the data to compare two key metrics:
Ride Frequency: How many trips are taken?
Ride Duration: How long does a typical trip last?

By grouping the results by user type and the day of the week, I can identify specific patterns—such as which group
uses the bikes for commuting (consistent, short trips) versus leisure (longer, weekend trips).

-- Querying frequency and duration by user type and day
SELECT  
  member_casual,
  day_of_week_num,
  COUNT(*) AS num_of_rides,
  ROUND(AVG(ride_length_mins)) AS avg_ride_duration
FROM `case-study-2025-483513.cyclistic_cs.2025_full_year_cleaned` 
GROUP BY
  member_casual, day_of_week_num
ORDER BY
  member_casual, day_of_week_num;
