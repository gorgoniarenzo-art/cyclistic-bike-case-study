Data Consolidation
To perform a year-wide analysis, I consolidated 12 individual monthly datasets (CSV files) into a single master table (2025_full_year)
using UNION ALL. This allows for a holistic view of seasonal trends across the entire year.

CREATE TABLE `cyclistic_cs.2025_full_year` AS
SELECT * 
FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_jan_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_feb_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_mar_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_apr_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_may_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_jun_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_jul_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_aug_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_sep_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_oct_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_nov_data`
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM `cyclistic_cs.2025_dec_data`;
  
Data Cleaning and Transformation 
Data cleaning was performed to ensure accuracy and create new variables for analysis:
  
Creating Calculated Columns: Created ride_length_mins, day_of_week, and month columns to enable time-series and categorical analysis.
Data Validation: Removed 'dirty' data, specifically trips with negative durations (system errors) or trips exceeding 24 hours (outliers).
Handling Missing Values: Excluded records with null or blank member_casual values to maintain data integrity.

CREATE TABLE `case-study-2025-483513.cyclistic_cs.2025_full_year_cleaned` AS
SELECT 
--Standardize time format
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', started_at) AS started_at,
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', ended_at) AS ended_at,
--Create ride_length_mins column by getting the timestamp difference
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) AS ride_length_mins,
--Create day_of_week column
  EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM started_at) AS day_of_week_num,
  FORMAT_DATE('%A', started_at) AS day_of_week_name,
--Create month column
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) AS month_num,
  FORMAT_DATE('%B', DATE(started_at)) AS month_name
FROM `case-study-2025-483513.cyclistic_cs.2025_full_year`
--Filter trip duration < 0 > 1440
WHERE TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) > 0 AND
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) < 1440
--Filter out missing rider types 
  AND member_casual IS NOT NULL
  AND member_casual != ' '
ORDER BY ride_length_mins DESC;
