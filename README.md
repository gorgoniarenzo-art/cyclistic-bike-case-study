**Project Overview**
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share program in Chicago. The marketing director believes that maximizing the number of annual members is the key to future growth. My task is to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Tools Used**
Data Cleaning: BigQuery
Analysis: SQL
Visualization: Tableau
Documentation: GitHub

**The Data Analysis Process**
1. Ask
Business Task: Analyze 12 months of historical trip data to identify trends in how casual riders and members use bikes differently.

Key Stakeholders: Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing), Cyclistic Executive Team.

2. Prepare
Data is stored in CSV files.

I used the last 12 months of data (Jan 2025 - Dec 2025).

Data has been verified for integrity (checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers).

3. Process
[Explain one major cleaning step, e.g., "Removed rides under 60 seconds and rides starting from maintenance stations."]

[Explain how you created new columns like ride_length and day_of_week.]

4. Analyze
Key findings from the analysis:

Usage Patterns: [Casual riders tend to ride longer on weekends, while members have consistent usage during weekday commute hours.]

Popular Stations: [Casual riders frequent tourist areas near the waterfront; members use stations closer to residential/office areas.]

5. Share

6. Act
Top 3 Recommendations:

Targeted Weekend Promotions: Offer "Weekend-only" memberships or discounts to casual riders who frequently use the service on Saturdays and Sundays.

Digital Campaign at Hotspots: Place marketing materials at the top 10 stations most frequented by casual riders.

Seasonal Benefits: Since casual usage peaks in summer, offer a "Summer Member Pass" to bridge the gap toward an annual subscription.
